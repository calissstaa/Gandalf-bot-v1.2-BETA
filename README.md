# Gandalf Discord Bot BETA

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/2oWPpv5ufns

## Description:

Is a discord bot that enables you to chat with a bot named Gandalf, anytime, anywhere.

This bot takes the command "Gandalf" or "Mithrandir" (case insensitive) to function.  Gandalf the bot is an inspired character from the "Lord of the Rings" and The Hobbit" movie trilogy "Gandalf the Grey". In the movie, Gandalf is known as a wise and grumpy wizard.

On the other hand, Gandalf the Bot is not really like the "real" Gandalf, this Gandalf-Bot's main purpose is only to be able to encourage others when they are in need or down. Although, there are a few commands that will make Gandalf reply with GIFS or exactly like in the movie (e.g. "You are late Gandalf"), some are mostly randomly generated quotes.

#### Features Includes:

- Say "hello" or "Bye" to Gandalf
- Ask how he is doing
- Ask for advice/encouragements
- Easter egg GIFS
- Random movie quotes.

## Code explanation:

There are three main code function that I used which are
` mymodule.py ` which is where I put all my modules in
` mydata.py ` the place where I put some of the datas
and finally ` main.py ` which is the main code funtion.

I also made a simple web application in ` keep_alive.py ` The function of this was to keep the codes running by pinging it with Uptimerobot.com

One of the technique I learnt along the making was the "switch-case" function in python, that was replaced by dictionary instead. Thanks to stackoverflow.
This technique was usefull in my case, as it enables me to do constant time search.

For the random generated quotes that Gandalf the Bot said was taken from an API that was made possible by [The One API Dev](https://the-one-api.dev/account )

As for the rest of the codes, there wasn't any other interesting methods I used except for some loops search and stuff.

Note: this is only the BETA version of Gandalf the Bot, and there are still lots of bugs and countless room for improvements.
